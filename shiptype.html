            <h2>E.B. Allen</h2>
            <p>The E.B. Allen first launched in 1864 by H.C. 
                Piersons at Ogdensburg, New York. On November 20, 1871
                the ship collided with the Newsboy 2 miles southeast of 
                Thunder Bay Island during a voyage to deliver grain. It
                remains underwater to this day, where most of the decking
                is gone and the masts are broken.

            <h2>J.J. Audubon</h2>
            <p>The J.J. Audubon was built in 1854 by G & W Jones 
                of Cleveland Ohio. On October 20, 1854 it collided
                into the DEFIANCE. It currently lies in 178 feet
                of water north of the Presque Isle.

            <h2> DEFIANCE </h2>
            <p> The DEFIANCE was built in 1848 by Captain Roby at
                Perryburg, Ohio. On October 20, 1854 around 1pm the ship 
                was run into by the J.J. Audubon off of Preque Isle. It 
                remains underwater, but much of its mast has been well 
                preserved and there is little damage to the hull.

            <h2> Studying shipwrecks </h2>
            <p> Studying shipwrecks is a wonderful way to learn
                about the history and structures of a ship. Additionally,
                the information gathered from these accidents could 
                provide vital information for future ships in terms of
                safety and caution. These are only a few examples of the 
                many possible shipwrecks to learn about all around the world.
                If you're interested in learning more, we highly encourage
                taking a look at the scuba diving clubs found on the home page. 
                There you will meet people with similar interests and perhaps
                you may even encounter a shipwreck too!
